Dear editor,

Hereby I submit the manuscript "Diamond plots: a tutorial to introduce a visualisation tool that facilitates interpretation and comparison of multiple sample estimates while respecting their inaccuracy".

In this manuscript, I introduce (and provide a tutorial to) a type of data visualisation of confidence intervals. This is useful in a variety of situations, for example when comparing means or different associations.

I submit it to Health Psychology Bulletin for three reasons. First, the manuscript strongly encourages full disclosure, which fits well with the HPB aims. Second, the manuscript promotes statistical best practices, specifically the use of confidence intervals. This also fits nicely with the journal's aims. Third, this method is already being applied and extended on in a number of other manuscripts. The manuscript fits the bill for one that might get cited quite highly, and thus, may attract more readers to HPB, which I think can be useful in the journal's current initial phase.

I hope you agree that this manuscript presents a very accessible, userfriendly visualisation tool, that wide application of this tool can address some of the problems associated with current statistical practice, and that you will consider publishing this paper in Health Psychology Bulletin.

Thank you in advance, kind regards,

Gjalt-Jorn Peters
